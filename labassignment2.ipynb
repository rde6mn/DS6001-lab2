    "There are several data files attached to this lab assignment, with different extensions. First, download all of these data files, and save them in the same folder on your local machine. Your task in the following questions is to load each file into Python correctly, so that you can begin the process of data cleaning. If the variable names are included in the file, use those names to name the columns. If the variable names are not included, use these names in order:\n"
